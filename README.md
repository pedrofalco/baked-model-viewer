**.welcome to our baked-model-viewer** üçû

Our GLB model viewer allows you to explore 3D models with baked textures in GLB format. You can upload your own GLB files containing color, emissive and/or alpha textures, and visualize them in a 3D environment with [point-locker-controls‚Üó](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/PointerLockControls)

Make sure to include the words `color`, `emissive`, and/or `alpha` in your image texture filenames.
